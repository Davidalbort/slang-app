### `Introduction`

* This project was created with React, Typescript, Recoil and Styled components in order to simulate Slang tech stack,
in order to resolve the Growth Engineer Recruitment Challenge

* This is an MVP created on 1 day

### `Development process`

* Reading and analizing the documentation (pdf with requirements)
* Creating mock desings (on paper notebook with the UI and general data flow, components structures and secuencial steps)
* Creating the project
* Creating all the data structure
* Creating the base states
* Creating general component's skeleton
* Creating basic logic and interaction between components
* Creating basic styling
* Created unit testing for components
* Added accessibility elements and polished semantic html
* Finished the whole functionality
* Finished the whole styling
* Added SEO elements
* Documented all the journey

### `Growth insights`

The approach to execute this task, was based on understanding the meaning of it, beyond a technical work.

My approach to it was to use gamification, being this a very powerful strategy to induce to continue using a product or service, taking into account the great power of dopamine as a positive reinforcer of behavior. (Hence the inclusion of levels and scoring system).

The UI was inspired by slot machines, in which the gaming industry has invested many decades polishing to favor the permanence of use.

The speed of delivery of this MVP, is due to the fact that in the business and technology world, speed and iteration is fundamental, since only a product that is launched quickly can receive feedback, with this feedback is improved in a new iteration, and so on. If a product takes too long to have contact with the user, it will have fewer iterations, less feedback and in the long run it will not improve properly. This is agile methodologies towards the product or service.

## `More Growth insights`

I took some notes about (Social media strategies, Google analytics tracking on some specific events, positive reinforcement, 
push notification reminders, more gamification, and others).

I would like to share these insights on a meeting if possible.

## `Final notes`

I really had a lot of fun doing this activity, I feel that it is able to assess the technical and non-technical ability that you at Slang expect for the position.

On a curious note, one part of the project planning and development, my little 2 year old girl was insistently trying to snatch the keyboard and mouse from me, apparently she was also interested in helping me to get this task done :)
